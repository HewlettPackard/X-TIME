# Datasets

Initial exploration of the datasets that are used in the paper. Goal was to explore these datasets, tto build the
preprocesing pipelines and obtain naive baseline classification/regression ML models.

Findings in these notebooks have been converted to python scripts in the `xtime.datasets` package.
